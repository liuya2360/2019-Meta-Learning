## Meeting Notes
change in complextiy of datasets -> change in distribution of alpha values  

characteristic of distribution of alpha values(e.g. position of turining points, number of turning points, etc) will be used as the meta features 

check the complexity of artificial datasets with japnit(e.g. value of k, number of separators...) 

plot the distribution of alpha using matplotlib 

generate hypothesis on the change in distribution of alpha due to different dataset complexity 


##To do list: 
* Finish algorithm description
   * HF, by this weekend, 5th May
* Edit the experiment setup description 
   * to be discussed by HF and LY 
* Generate the other three sets of $\alpha$ values for artificial datasets 
    * LY, by this weekend
* Talk to Japnit about the generation of artificial datasets and the parameters
    * e.g. value of $k$, number of separators, etc. (parameters of artificial datasets) 
    * LY, by Sat
* Generate the distribution graphs of all sets of $\alpha$ values using matplotlib 
    * LY, by this weekend
* Discuss about the correlation between the complexity of datasets and their $\alpha$ values 
    * need to hypothesis possible correlation between the $\alpha$ and dataset compelxity 
        * e.g. mean $\alpha$ = 1 suggest something about the instance space (two distinct clusters far apart from each other)
    * need to identify the feature of the distribution of $\alpha$ values, which can later be used as meta features for meta learning 
    * to be discussed together, (time) tbc


##Other notes
This research, together with a JH4 student's research on the theory, will be submitted for ICML at the start of next Jan, and ECML in late April and early May. Before this two submissions, the research itself might be submitted for some autoML workshop, at which both HF and LY need to present their work. By that time, the experiment might not have been all done, but we can present our hypothesis and ideas.
