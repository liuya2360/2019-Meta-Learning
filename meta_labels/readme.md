# Meta Labels

## accuracy.csv 

File contains 10 times 10-fold cross validation prediction accuracy of models of k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), Naive Bayes (NB) and Decision Tree (DT) for datasets. 

## labels.csv 

The average accuracy for models built by the 3 algorithms are compared pair-wise using t-test. Each dataset  has 3 labels indicating the superiority of models of the 3 pairs. One meta-label is then assigned to each dataset using the 3 labels based on the table in **label_rules.xlsx**
