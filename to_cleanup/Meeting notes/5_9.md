##Meeting Notes 
###Feedback on the write up 
- the write up is generally ok 
- need to add in the experiment description till whatever we have done 

###Suggestion on analysis of $\alpha$
- calculate the $\alpha$ shift 
- calculate correlation based on $r^2$ 

###Generate new meta labels for artificial datasets 
Instead of doing t-test on every combination of algorithms, we choose the best algorihtm with the highest accuracy, and do t-test on the best algorithm and the other algorithms, if there is no difference, then it is labelled 1, the rest are labelled 0  
As a result, for each dataset, the meta label will a sequence of binary code
